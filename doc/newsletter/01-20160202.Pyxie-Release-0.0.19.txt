# Sparkslabs Update #1 : New Pyxie Release 0.0.19

# New Pyxie Release 0.0.19

## Released: 31st January 2016

The main focus of this release is the start of python 3 support and
continued work on the practicalities of creating C++ for arduinos from
python, with a primary focus on digital/analog input/output and control of
servos.
 
## What is Pyxie?

Pyxie is a Python to C++ compiler, targetted specifically at embedded
systems and microcontroller devices.

The aim is to allow a adults and children to write code in a familiar high
level language that can then be compiled to run on an arbitrary embedded
system - that is devices with very low power CPUs and very little memory. 
(ie devices too small to host a python interpreter/runtime)

It's pre-alpha at the moment, but approaching the stage where it can be
useful with arduino leonardo style devices.

## Changelog

### What's New?

* Changes to support Python 3
* Now runs under python 3 as well as python 2 :-)
* (internals) Pynode docs - very much work in progress
* Arduino blink test case copied into examples
* Makes testing easier and usage more obvious

### What's been fixed?

* Fix regression in code generation for function calls
* This was due to FunctionCalls now assuming they work on a callable which
  may be an identifier, but can also be other things too

### Internal changes

* Massive reorg of pynodes from single file to categorised files
* Use annotated tags for releases - makes them show up on github - showing releases
* Help text for pyxie-dev extended to show release process
* Bump versions for 0.0.19

### Other

* Work on arduino profile continues with more work on servos (still WIP)
* Bump copyright notices to 2016(!)
* Add link to latest release on homepage

## Feedback?

As usual, feedback is welcome.  What would you like to see?  Would you like
more detail, less detail?  Suggestions for project direction also very
welcome.

## Finally

Would you consider supporting this project via kickstarter to speed up
development?  If you would, how much would you consider reasonable to
pledge?
