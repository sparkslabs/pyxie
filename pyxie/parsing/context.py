# I was going to have a stack of contexts. Instead, I'll maintain
# a stack but allow them to point to their parent. This actually means
# all contexts actually form a graph - which is true. (Many local contexts can
# point at a parent context)
#
# This then allows looking in the current context, and then outwards.
#
# A context is a collection of names inside a scope.
#
# Names that are bound within that scope can be well defined in that they bind to a
# literal value that has a type, or to the result of an expression which again has
# a clear derivable state.
#
# Names that are not bound into this state, by contrast are free variables.
# Free variables are not allows in little python at present, since they are potentially
# poly-typed
#
# While I can see my original point, having PyIdentifiers as the values here is kinda odd,
# since really the values associated with the names is the key point here, and the values
# are themselves more expression-result-types, not identifiers.
#
# As a result, contexts themselves need rework here
#
# Context Leakage is a very bad name.
#
# In fact, in any given context, an identifier gets assigned the results of an expression
# This may happen more than once.
#
# There are some problem scenarios:
#
#  * The results of two (or more) expressions assigned to a name are conflicting types
#  * An expression uses a name that is not yet well defined at that point in a program
#
# Suggests the following strategy:
#
#  * So, we should go through the program, assigning *expressions* to names in contexts
#  * When we need the type of an identifier, we look in it's context for the name, find
#    an expression and evaluate it's type
