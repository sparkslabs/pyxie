## Open Source, Apache 2 License

Pyxie is &copy; Copyright 2015, Michael Sparks

It is released as open source, under the Apache 2 License.

The short summary of this is that you can:

* Use this for any purpose
* Modify, and distribute the code
* Contribute back :-)
* In exchange you must keep copyright notices intact, include licenses, state changes etc.

Where this summary conflicts with the license text below, the license text wins.

Note: You need explicit permission to *incorporate* this into a GPL v2 project.
Usage by a GPLv2 project though is fine :-)
