## Detailed Development status

The purpose of this page is for those who wonder "what's being
done/planned", either because they're just interested or potentially
interested in contributing.  That should explain the ordering.  Numbers have
no relevance, aside from to allow identification of a given task in git
commits. _(This is exported from trello)_
